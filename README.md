* Notes for Command-T installation:
1. Macintosh OS should have Ruby and Vim installed by default but is very likely that Vim is linked to
   a different version of Ruby, which will cause segmentation fault when you type <header>t in Vim after
   you have Commmand-T plugin installed.
2. Solution: use ruby --version and vim --version to find, first, is current Vim support Ruby and second
   what version of Ruby Vim is linked to. Then install the right version for both Ruby and Vim.
